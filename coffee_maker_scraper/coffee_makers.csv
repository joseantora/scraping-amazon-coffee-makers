"        Hamilton Beach 49976 FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker, Compatible with K-Cup Pods or Grounds, Combo, Single Serve & Full 12c Pot, Black       ",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y2WCHDV,5.0 out of 5 stars,I tried the K-cups with Community breakfast blend. I had coffee grinds completely throughout my coffee. It was not even drinkable. I used the filter(provided) and used my own Community breakfast blend. This second cup came out great. I did want to use the k-cups as advertised. I will update after a few more cups.

To begin with, it's easy to use, use one side or the other. I normally program my carafe side the night before so my coffee is ready in the morning. It's easy enough with this machine. I have not tried to program the single brew side, but I am sure it works well.  My only negative, which probably won't bother most coffee drinkers is that the coffee comes out too hot.  I usually place two ice cubes in my cup when I pour my morning joe.  But that's just me, most people like it hot."

Because of the modular design of the k cup holder, you just need to make sure when you place the k cup in, that you feel it get punctured by the bottom needle. The top needle does not need much pressure because it only punctures the foil top of the k cups, so just by closing the cover you will be fine. I use the single brew side to brew iced tea."

Folks stated that french roast beans would not feed properly.  Generally I only use Kicking Horse coffee (Kick Ass and Decaf blended).  I do something some purists will hate... I freeze the beans.  Folks say you shouldn't and the real issue is moisture.... so if you freeze them it has to be AIR TIGHT.  I use glad slide lock freezer bags and squeeze all the air out.  I have NEVER not once had any problem with beans feeding....  UNTIL I ran out of my Kicking Horse coffee and bought ONE bag of Star Bucks French Roast.  When I opened the bag the beans seamed very oily.  Within 2 cups the feeder was NOT working.

He and I have both been waiting on this part for far too long now.  In the meantime, I have been weaned from coffee!!  But my customers will still want some, so I'm stuck with the coffee pot that does not work.

When I have time or company I brew an elegant pour over with my Chemex, for example. Or I use a Keurig for a quick cup to take in the car. But in the dark winter mornings it is lovely to simply wake to the aroma of a freshly brewed pot of coffee and to know it will stay hot in the stainless steel carafe. I can prepare this GE the night before and in the morning all I have to do is pour my cup!  The digital display is simple and stylish (blue display). It is really easy to set the current time as well as the brew timer, unlike many things these days. The “bold” setting really makes a delicious difference if the coffee lends itself to that.  The display illuminates when you set it but then goes dark after a bit so it is not distracting. It’s very classy on the counter. Absolutely no drips from the carafe. And no beeps from this machine. This uses a #4 cone filter. All the coffee I have prepared with this is delicious. It seems substantial and well made, and I would purchase it again. There is really nothing I don’t like about it, as it does what it promises. Well done, GE!"

"        Takeya Iced Tea Maker with Patented Flash Chill Technology Made in USA, 2 Quart, Black       ",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0095ZBJT2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a really well made product.  It makes it super easy to brew your own loose leaf iced tea.  Dropping the infuser into hot water is really simple since it screws into the lid of the pitcher.  After brewing, you lift it back out and drop it into the cup they provide (a nice touch, even though any cup would do the same job).  Fill it the rest of the way with ice and screw down the top and shake.  This is actually a really nice feature.  The tall design of the pitcher prevents you from splashing yourself with hot tea when dropping in the ice.  And, by sealing down tight, you can shake your tea until it's cold.  (When I was looking online, I thought this was just a marketing gimmick, but it makes a huge difference in how quickly you get to enjoy your iced tea.). And, it fits really well on the refrigerator door."

Previous maker was a budget Mr. Coffee with VERY accurate reviews about it dripping when pulling pot off warmer. It was a mess. I thought a drip or two would be a issue but it was a lot! So...started looking for a coffee maker again. Wife and I love our coffee so this one was a bonus at 14 cups(only one that I know if that has this capacity)  Plus, we like the Hamilton Beach brand. So, it's been a couple of weeks and MANY pots of coffee made and we really love the maker. Brews the 14 cups FAST and it looks great on the counter as well. While you can simply use the cone screen filter that comes with it, like most screen filters it's a bit of a pain in the butt to get all the grounds washed out so we bought the specific cone style filters and they work great and makes clean up easier.  Can't recommend enough."

It makes it super easy to brew your own loose leaf iced tea.  Dropping the infuser into hot water is really simple since it screws into the lid of the pitcher.  After brewing, you lift it back out and drop it into the cup they provide (a nice touch, even though any cup would do the same job).  Fill it the rest of the way with ice and screw down the top and shake.  This is actually a really nice feature.  The tall design of the pitcher prevents you from splashing yourself with hot tea when dropping in the ice.  And, by sealing down tight, you can shake your tea until it's cold.  (When I was looking online, I thought this was just a marketing gimmick, but it makes a huge difference in how quickly you get to enjoy your iced tea.). And, it fits really well on the refrigerator door."

There are many simple solutions to all the problems you may be encountering.  First, coffee grounds in your coffee, buy cheap coffee filters tear a little hole in the center and slide it around the brew rod.  Second, coffee getting cold, leave it plugged in until your finished drinking, it will not harm it.  I do it all the time and have for years.  Third, fill the water to the 12 cup line, eyeball putting your coffee in the filter one placed in the basket.  Leave 1/4 inch from the top.  I like it strong.  You can do coarse ground coffee and bypass the regular coffee filter but the coarser the coffee the weaker the coffee.  I am an avid coffee drinker and have been for years.

That's the case here. The lid of the carafe will not stay open because it opens up only to exactly the vertical and then flops closed. If it opened say 10 degrees past vertical, then when on the counter and I'm attempting to pour in the water from my Zero Water pitcher it would stay open on its own. Also, difficult to pour water into the reservoir because of the design of the lit on the unit. Will not open far enough to be out of the way. A safety issue is the poor placement of the on/off switch. It's on the side at the bottom. I keep it plugged in on my counter all the time with other things near like a toaster and other items. When moving it around during to day to use other items, if it even slightly bumps agains something else, the rocker switch turns on and it is not noticable because of its location. So, a number of times I've had it on and not know it. A huge safety ussue regarding overheating as it could be on all day and damage the unit or even start a fire.

"        Cuisinart DCC-3400P1 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Thermal Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6T5QNO,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This review is for the DCC-3400 machine with a thermal carafe. This machine makes great tasting coffee, has simple intuitive operation, does not take up much space on the counter, and is *really* good looking. I recently purchased this to replace a similar Cuisinart model that I had for over 12 years. And the previous one was still working fine - it had just gotten dingy after daily use for so many years. I prefer using a thermal carafe because I usually stretch a pot of coffee over several hours, and coffee gets a burnt taste when heated for that long with a heating plate. The primary advantage of the thermal carafe (besides looking really nice) is that it keeps the coffee hot through insulation of the carafe, and not by continuously heating the carafe. So there are three things you need to know (1) the plate that it sits on does not heat up, (2) coffee in the carafe is going to lose heat over the course of a day; that is physics and it's unavoidable. However, it loses heat at a very slow rate. The coffee remains hot for several hours throughout the morning after it has been brewed, and even by the afternoon I would call it very warm - that's 9-10 hours after it was brewed and would be burnt coffee sludge if it were directly heated for that long, and (3) the lid is designed to maintain a seal that reduces the rate of heat loss, but you don't have to twist or open anything to pour a cup. For this reason, the coffee pours more slowly than if the spout were just open. But honestly, the difference is along the lines of taking 4 seconds to fill a cup instead of 2 seconds. I don't understand the claims in other reviews about spilling when pouring, unless they are turning the carafe upside down to try to make it pour faster. The spout pours just fine and I've noticed that this model actually pours a little faster than the previous one I had. If the spout were more open, the carafe would lose heat more quickly. The only way to seal it further would be to design a lid that needs to be twisted open when you want to pour (like a thermos), and it would still lose heat at a faster rate every time you open it. I feel that the design of this carafe strikes the right balance between the seal needed to retain heat and ease of pouring. Another bonus is that the carafe does not need to sit in the coffee maker to stay warm - when serving coffee to a group I can keep the pot right on the table or wherever is most convenient. A thermal carafe may not fit the bill for everyone, but if you need a pot of coffee to stay hot for several hours without eventually tasting burnt, I highly recommend this machine."

Note that I've only had it about a month. This was a purchase made from frustration with the typical ""glass"" carafes with most machines. I always break them, then must replace the whole machine. Waste of money and upsetting to boot. Stainless steel was a logical choice, but expensive. Two drawbacks, more a nuisance than a complaint. 1) The water fill spot is narrow, wedged in the back right side corner. I use a funnel to pour the water into it, so problem solved. 2) Except for the first two cups, the carafe pours steadily albeit slowly, due to the seal between the carafe and the lid to it. Not unexpected, as air must be permitted to enter to let the coffee pour out. Plus on this is I'm less likely to miss the cup while pouring, and it has a hefty pour spout too, so aiming is no problem, no drips."

There’s a button that said ‘Thick’ and I believe that meant ‘strong’ and sure enough, that’s what it was.  It’s self-shutoff after two hours and keeps coffee hot and makes a good cup of ‘joe."

It has only been 2 weeks and I have only used the pod for ground coffee but the flavor is great. It is easy to use. I like the water reservoir so I don't have to add water every time. I have been using filtered water in it.

That should tell you something about this coffee maker right?! I just love it! It made the perfect cup of coffee for one. It seems like everyone is trying to declutter and downsize what's on kitchen counters. This is perfect for a very small space. It has a nice sized tank in the back for the water though. You can fill it for quite a few cups of coffee. I filled it last night to see if it leaks. Nope. Dry as a bone on my counter top. That would have been a deal breaker if it leaked. The coffee was made quick and it tasted just like it smelled... wonderful. I like the fact there's absolutely no clean up. No pot to have to wash or filter mess. Just throw the preloaded pod you may have purchased away or rinse out the pod that you can fill with your own coffee. I'm choosing to spoil myself right now with a purchased variety pack of pods. If you are a tea drinker you aren't left out! There's an included loose tea pod to make the perfect cup of tea. I sat down with my cup of coffee right after it was done. It was plenty hot enough but I did have to nuke it to make it piping hot! Not an issue for me. Coffee is never stays hot enough for me unless I put it in an insulated mug. This is a great purchase and highly recommend it! Enjoy!!

But many times, I need a single cup quickly. I began looking at single-cup machines. I wanted one that was very competent. The machine needed to be easy to use, but also make good coffee. No point in getting a bad cup of coffee no matter what machine you use! I came across this one from SIFENE, and decided to give it a try. After using it for a few weeks, I'm very happy with it."
