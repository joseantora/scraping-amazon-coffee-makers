"        Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Brew Options, Glass Carafe (46299), Black with Stainless Accents       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been meaning to write this a while: I LOVE IT - Prior to this, probably for 15 years!) I used a 12 cup Mr Coffee with auto shutoff, and I wanted a good, simple, reliable 12 cup coffee maker with auto shut off, that's all. I read the reviews in here on all the coffee makers with these features and then narrowed down to this, and a few higher priced units. This seemed the best deal, and I'm very happy I decided on it. All the issues I had with the Mr Coffee, (and the only issue that comes to mind was that pouring with a full carafe meant uncontrollable spills, lol) have been solved by Hamilton Beach, and every time I make a pot of coffee, I think about how much I love this coffee maker, and how I should make sure to put a review up for everybody to use in their decision making. I've tried the different settings - 'Bold', 'Regular' and '1-4 cups', and all work as advertised. Programming is easy and reliable, and I'm very happy with my purchase."
"        Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Brew Options, Glass Carafe (46299), Black with Stainless Accents       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't imagine what the negative reviews are about.  I love this coffee maker.  I replace my machine annually and at this price, I can afford to.  It makes good, hot strong coffee and fully saturates the beans.  The warmer keeps the coffee hot without a burnt or bitter taste.  The pause and pour works as well as any other brand that I have purchased, and I learned long ago to stop throwing money away on expensive brands (that are like rolling the device with your substantial investment).  This coffee maker is a workhorse that gives me a good cup of java every morning."
"        Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Brew Options, Glass Carafe (46299), Black with Stainless Accents       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I do not drink coffee, but ""the one who must be obeyed"" does.  She likes it; says it makes good coffee.  Guests say the same.  It is easy to operate, easy to clean.  Our previous one lasted 7-8 years before it clogged (she did not clean it regularly).  You need to clean the reservoir about every 100 cups if you have a lot of calcium carbonate (white chalky residue-water spots) in your water.  I use a vinegar flush, but you follow the instructions."
"        Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Brew Options, Glass Carafe (46299), Black with Stainless Accents       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Paid 24 bucks for this great little coffee maker. This is after returning a coffee maker costing quadruple. (I won't mention the brand name, but it begins with a C). Returned that maker because that brand had jumped on this whole ""hotter is better"" nonsense. People, you must remember, there is a constant battle by these corporations to get inside your wallet. Any marketing myth, half truth, or trend du jour, that helps them accomplish this is just fine by them. Nothing is further from the truth than this notion that brewing coffee with water that is practically boiling hot makes the best tasting coffee. In fact the opposite is true. It actually results in coffee tasting stripped of all it's flavor and having a dry, burnt flavor. Not a fan of D.D. coffee?? This is exactly why you are not. I wouldn't exactly say I'm a coffee snob, however, I do insist on a great cuppa in the morning. I can assure you this 24 dollar coffee maker makes a really great tasting cup of coffee. On the negative side of things I would say that what other reviewers have noted about the carafe's glass being a bit delicate is true, so be careful. Not really an issue for me so far."

"        Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Brew Options, Glass Carafe (46299), Black with Stainless Accents       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,I used to turn to Mr. Coffee for inexpensive or at least reasonably priced coffee makers.  In recent years the build  quality of Mr. Coffee has gone way down. I went through three different coffee makers within 3-6 months.  I turned to Hamilton Beach.  I have one that's been doing daily duty for years.  My mom experienced the same thing with her Mr. Coffees.  So I bought her this model.  It's still going strong.
"        Hamilton Beach 12 Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Brew Options, Glass Carafe (46299), Black with Stainless Accents       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This Hamilton beach coffee maker is so easy to use. I love to wake up in the mornings to the smell of coffee so the programmable timer works great for me. It's super easy to clean and even has the option of a reusable coffee filter. It also has a large opening to the water reservoir which makes it easy to fill without spilling like other coffee makers. I know I can rely on this coffee to get my day going, I'd give it 6 stars if I could."

To begin with, it's easy to use, use one side or the other. I normally program my carafe side the night before so my coffee is ready in the morning. It's easy enough with this machine. I have not tried to program the single brew side, but I am sure it works well.  My only negative, which probably won't bother most coffee drinkers is that the coffee comes out too hot.  I usually place two ice cubes in my cup when I pour my morning joe.  But that's just me, most people like it hot."
"        Hamilton Beach 49976 FlexBrew Trio 2-Way Coffee Maker, Compatible with K-Cup Pods or Grounds, Combo, Single Serve & Full 12c Pot, Black       ",4.0 out of 5 stars,"The single serve, or k cup side, works great. Because of the modular design of the k cup holder, you just need to make sure when you place the k cup in, that you feel it get punctured by the bottom needle. The top needle does not need much pressure because it only punctures the foil top of the k cups, so just by closing the cover you will be fine. I use the single brew side to brew iced tea."
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We've replaced an older Cuisinart DCC-1200 with this DCC-3200.  Since it's a popular line, I thought others might be interested in how they compare.  (In the attached comparison photos, the 1200 is on the left and the 3200 is on the right):"
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Taste:  Coffee in the 3200 is more flavorful.  A new machine might be expected to be better, but I think they've gotten the flow and temperature of the brewing process better."
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",3.0 out of 5 stars,"Temperature:  The brewed coffee is much hotter.  Both units have three temperature settings for the hot plate, but the settings on the 3200 are hotter."
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Size and Capacity. The 3200 handles 14 cups compared to the 1200's 12 cups.  Yet as you can see from the photos, they are the same height to fit on a counter.  They seem to get the extra capacity by making the 3200 a little deeper from front to back.  We've been surprised at how useful the extra capacity is."
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Carafe:  The new glass carafe is just like the old one, only larger.  It pours nicely with or without the lid on it.  The new lid works the same as the old one, popping off and on.  (I read some complaints about the lid on an intervening model with a spring opening, but if so, they fixed that by going back to the 1200 style)."
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"As far as I can tell, there isn't a version of the 3200 designed for a thermal carafe like there is for the 12-cup models.  I prefer the glass carafe because it keeps the coffee hotter longer, and I can always pour the coffee into a thermal carafe if I want to."
"        Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 PerfecTemp 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Stainless Steel       ",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Water Filling.  The bigger size also increases the size of the water fill hole.  The lid on the top of the 3200 unit raises to 90 degrees straight up, where the lid on the 1200 tilted further back and out of the way.  Still the 3200 is easier to fill, and I suspect that the restriction on the tilt may help preserve the integrity of the hot water tube."

"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,AMENDED REVIEW
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ours is still working perfectly.  Unfortunately you can't find it for $20 any more.  I wanted to address some of the negative reviews and offer a suggestion for one type of issue some folks have noted. Some reviews say it is noisy; that's not my experience. I find it makes no more noise than the myriad of previous coffee makers we have owned, of many brands. And as far as I can tell, there is no obnoxious taste to the coffee coming from the plastic used."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Some have noted that the paper filter collapses, allowing coffee to overflow around the filter sometimes into the basket and then down into the carafe. This happened once or twice for me. The first thing I noticed was that if the filter paper is in the least bit folded over, the design of the maker will drip water between the basket and the filter paper, resulting in the wet filter folding in on itself. I made sure the filter paper was against the back of basket wall and that problem stopped."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Another issue some have experienced is that the basket will not drain adequately and it fills up and over the sides. I have not had that experience; however that is most likely a result of the carafe top not firmly pushing up on the basket release valve that allows the basket to drain into the carafe. I found a goof-proof way around this, for me anyway. I remove the carafe, then install the filter and coffee, add the water and then firmly close the lid. The last thing I do is place the carafe on the heating pad while holding down the lid slightly.  If you don't do this and just insert the carafe, the carafe lid will push up on the basket valve but seems at the same time to lift the entire basket slightly, thus not fully opening the valve. You want the valve to open, not lift the basket. So just install the carafe as the last thing you do and put some pressure down on the top as you do this and that will hold the basket in place and the drain valve will be fully open as you insert the carafe - dirt simple solution and so far it works every time; hopefully for others. At $20 it was a tremendous value."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,ORIGINAL REVIEW
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I looked at many, more expensive coffee makers and none were without their warts. So I decided to just find the least expensive one that met my needs. This one turned out to be a gem for less than $20 (I paid $19.99). It came in ""industrial strength"" packaging and as soon as it arrived I tried out all features and functions; everything worked as advertised. The only minor nit is that the carafe lid does not seem removable; you would probably break it attempting to remove it. The top was removable on other carafes I have had, making it easier to clean, but on balance it doesn't matter as everything is easy to clean. Admittedly, this review is right out of the box and we have only two days using it so reliability is an unknown. If that becomes an issue later on, I will amend the review, but for now I feel this is a great value for the price."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"What am I looking for? - a good cup of HOT coffee. It's that simple. The coffee maker itself is ""cheaper"" in the way it is made, but if you are a coffee snob like myself, all you want is a Good cup of HOT coffee.  This coffee pot brewed my coffee at 197.9 degrees = EXCELLENT = I got a very good cup OF HOT coffee. Couldn't ask for anything more. If you want a coffee pot for its ""looks"" or perfect functions, look elsewhere. If you want a delicious cup of hot coffee and also want to save $100, buy this coffee maker."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",3.0 out of 5 stars,Update. It's been 9 months and I will be throwing this away. The filter basket does not allow water to flow out fast enough. Causing the filter to either over flow or fold over and the grounds go into the coffee. It did it with only 3 cups of water this morning. I never could fill past 6 cups anyways.
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars, It seems no matter what I do I get grounds into the pot. The filter always overflows when making full pots. That's the only complaint but it's a big issue.
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"My last coffee maker was the cheapest one I saw at the store.  It lasted almost 5 years and was only replaced because it was white and had coffee stains that made it look dirty. It still worked. I replaced it with this. It stopped working in 2 months, only being used a couple of times a week. I've never had a coffee maker with such a short life, and definitely will be going with a different brand this time around."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, a no nonsense easy to use, inexpensive coffee maker for those of us who are fed-up with expensive, short-lived coffee makers. The display is not to bright at night and very easy to read in the day.  The programming buttons are straight forward and very simple to use for people who tend to be a little technologically challenged (spouse).  There was a power outage today and getting this coffee maker back up to its prior programmed state took less than a minute. The last time I had a power outage (happens frequently in the woods) using my previous expensive coffee maker, the display never came back to a legible brightness level, I had to wait until it was dark to reprogram and it took much longer than it should have.  I trashed that expensive coffee maker and replaced it with this one so if any thing ever happens to this machine, I can just buy another. In fact, I could replace this machine 3 times for the same price as one of those other machines without sacrificing quality."
"        Black+Decker CM1160B 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, Black/Stainless Steel       ",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Thought we could use this for the communal office coffee pot but it was a no go.  Item arrived in manufacturer’s packaging with the lid broken at the hinge on the lid. The “hinge” was so flimsy it didn’t look like it would have lasted anyway.  Figured not a big deal and opted to try keeping it.  The water diffuser is connected to the top of the lid and it is of the worst construction I have ever seen.  Not to mention every brew attempt tasted like plastic  chemicals.  Also, while the pot comes with a 2-hour warming period before it shuts off, this is pointless when the coffee is burned to sludge within an hour, even if it is sitting with half a pot.  Considering how many $20 coffee pots are on the market, this one was returned."
